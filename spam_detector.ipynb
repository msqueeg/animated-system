    "In this exercise we are applying two different models, logistic regression and random forest, to a spam email dataset to see which does a better job of learning to identify spam emails. Logistic regression is a linear model that works well with binary classification tasks, such as spam detection. it works well when the relationship between the features of the data set and the target variable are easily approximated by a straight line or plane. It is computationally efficient, which makes it a good choice for tassk with a large number of features and a moderately sized data set. It doesn't do well with capturing complex, non-linear relationships between the features and the target.\n",

    "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. it's a highly flexible method that is better suited to capturing complex relationships between features and a target variable. It handles noisy data well, however, it can be computationally more expensive than compared to logistic regression.\n",

    "Comparing these two methods, I would expect that logistic regression would do well capturing the relationship between features, such as keywords, and the target spam/\"ham\" classification. However, I would expect that, even when they do well, most linear models are an oversimplification of the relationship between a datasets' features and the clasification. Linear relationships will model the dominant relationships in the dataset, but there is probably additional information that could still be captured with a different model that might give us better precision and recall for the target classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suspect that while spam email datasets generally do have strong correlations between features and the target variable that have traditionally made them strong candidates for linear statistical techniques such logistic regression, there is enough underlying complexity in the relationship between the various features and the target that a non-linear model might very well do a better job of capturing that relationship and have better precision and recall.\n"
